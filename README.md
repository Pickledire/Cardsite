# Magic Card React Demo

This project is a simple React application that displays a single card styled to look like a Magic: The Gathering card. The card is centered on the screen and uses custom CSS for an authentic MTG appearance.

## Features
- Magic: The Gathering inspired card design
- Responsive and centered layout
- Easily extendable for more cards or features

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the card.

## Project Structure
- `src/index.js` – Entry point, imports global styles and main component
- `src/index.css` – Global styles and centering
- `src/components/cards/card.jsx` – Card component
- `src/components/cards/cardcss.css` – Magic card-specific styles

## Notes
- For now, the site only displays a single card in the center of the screen.
- You can customize the card's content and appearance by editing `card.jsx` and `cardcss.css`.

Feel free to expand this project with more cards, interactivity, or game logic!
